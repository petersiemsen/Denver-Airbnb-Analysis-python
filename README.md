# Denver-Airbnb-Analysis-python

Since its inception in 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique and personalized way. The data set includes the following Airbnb activity for the city of Denver, CO:

• Unique property listings in Denver, including full descriptions and average review score

• Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments

• Calendar bookings, including the listing id, the price and availability for that day (at the time the data was gathered)

The objective of this project will be to get a better understanding of the short-term and long-term rental industry in Denver. Airbnb allows everyday people to list their properties as available to rent, but I want to get a better understanding of how that is actually taking place. I will also be looking into financial variables related to each listing to try and gather insight on profitable neighborhoods, types of rentals, and seasonality. With a better understanding of the rental space in Denver, the analysis should be able to provide trends that new investors can use when determining if this type of business is right for them and how best to get started.
