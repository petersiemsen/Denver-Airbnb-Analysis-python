# Denver-Airbnb-Analysis-python

Since its inception in 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to travel in a more unique and personalized way. I was contacted by a real estate investing company, Siemsen LLC, to investigate the Denver Airbnb market. The data set includes the following Airbnb activity for the city of Denver, CO and was sourced from from a website called [Insideairbnb.com](http://insideairbnb.com/denver):

• Unique property listings in Denver, including full descriptions and average review score

• Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments

• Calendar bookings, including the listing id, the price and availability for that day (at the time the data was gathered)

The objective of this project will be to get a better understanding of the short-term and long-term rental industry in Denver. Airbnb allows everyday people to list their properties as available to rent, but I want to get a better understanding of how that is actually taking place. I will also be looking into financial variables related to each listing to try and gather insight on profitable neighborhoods, types of rentals, and seasonality. With a better understanding of the rental space in Denver, the analysis will aim to understand trends that the client can use when determining if this market makes sense for furutre investing and where the best location is to get started.



I conducted my analysis both in Python and Tableau and created a public dashboard to summarize my findings, which can be viewed [HERE](https://public.tableau.com/shared/X9CHRKQGT?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).
